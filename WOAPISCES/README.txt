These data have been provided by Olivier Aumont. These data have been
computed by a coupled NEMO-PISCES global model. These results have
been obtained from quite short coupled physical-biogeochemical
run. They have to be considered as EXPERIMENTAL DATA.

Take care, there are discontinuties in the South Atlantic fields,
there are problems of grid connection, it has'nt been done properly
while the simulations have been runned.

Nevertheless, these data can be use to compute the initial and
boundary conditions BUT I invite you to check these fields, in order
to check your region isn't affected by the problems cited above and
more generally to verify the quality of the experimental data.

Big fix Correction on time axis for

- dic_seas.cdf
- doc_seas.cdf
- fer_seas.cdf
- no3_seas.cdf
- po4_seas.cdf
- si03_seas.cdf
- talk_seas.cdf

Now the time variable T is [0.5 :1: 11.5]
[0.5, 1, 2.5 , 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.6, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, 10.5, 11.5]
an not [1.5 :1:12.5], in order to avoid 1 month shift.
